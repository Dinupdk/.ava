                     types of variables in Java  --> 1. local, 2. instance, 3. static

1. Local Variables
Definition: Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
Scope: Limited to the block in which it is declared.
Example: Temporary calculations or loop counters.

2. Instance Variables
Definition: Declared inside a class but outside any method or block. They are non-static fields tied to an instance of the class.
Scope: Accessible by all non-static methods in the class using the object.
Default Values: Initialized with default values (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects).
Example: Attributes of an objec


3. Static Variables
Definition: Declared with the static keyword inside a class but outside any method.
Scope: Shared among all objects of the class (class-level scope).
Lifetime: Exists throughout the program's execution.
Example: Constants or counters shared across instances.




Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


                           Java Primitive data types:

1. boolean data type
2. byte data type
3. char data type
4. short data type
5. int data type
6. long data type
7. float data type
8. double data type

Operators in Java
Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.

 

There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:

Unary Operator --> increment, decrement Operators  x++,++x,y--,--y
Arithmetic Operator +,-,*,/,%,
Shift Operator   <<,>>,
Relational Operator,
Bitwise Operator,
Logical Operator,
Ternary Operator and
Assignment Operator.
